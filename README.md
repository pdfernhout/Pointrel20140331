Pointrel20140331
================

A version of the Pointrel data repository system in HTML5/CSS/JavaScript

This stores snippets of HTML entered in a text area. These snippets can be displayed in a list below the edit box. TiddlyWiki was a bit of an inspiration for that list display. This is intended to support "bootstrapping" more a more complex system, such as Doug Engelbart worked toward to support a co-evolution of tools, knolwedge, communtiy, and processes.

To use this, first open the source/PointrelBoostrapLoader.html file in a web browser (which also loads require.js included in that directory). Then as a demo you can cut and paste in the contents of bootstrap/bootstrap.json into the text field and click the "Replace All" button. There are hover hints over the buttons suggesting what they can do.

The project's source code itself is under the MIT license.
The boostrap.json file contains content under a mix of different FOSS licenses.
